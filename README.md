=======

The Wondrous Yahtzee-bot, a.k.a. fun with unittest.

Play yahtzee from the command line.  Enter a string of integers to represent the roll, a text value indicating how to score the roll (e.g., "full house"), and an integer representing the starting score.

ex: 
>$ python yahtzee.py 11122 full_house 100
